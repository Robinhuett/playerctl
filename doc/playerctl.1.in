.SH DESCRIPTION
.RE
\fBplayerctl\fR is a command line utility to control MPRIS-enabled media\&
players. In addition to offering play/pause/stop control, \fBplayerctl\fR\&
also offers previous/next track support, the ability to seek backward/forward\&
in a track, and volume control.
\fBplayerctl\fR also supports displaying metadata (e.g. artist/title/album) for the\&
current track, and showing the status of the player.
.PP
Players that can be controlled using \fBplayerctl\fR include audacious, cmus,\&
mopidy, mpd, quod libet, rhythmbox, vlc and xmms2. However, any player that implements\&
the MPRIS interface specification should be able to be controlled using \fBplayerctl\fR.

A format string can be given with the \fB--format\fR argument to print properties and metadata in a particular format. Variable names between curly braces in the form of \fB{{\fR \fIVARIABLE\fR \fB}}\fR will be expanded to their values. The available variables are the names of the commands that print properties or any of the metadata keys that can be viewed with the \fBmetadata\fR command. The name of the player is also available with the \fBplayerName\fR variable.

Several helper functions are available in the template language to transform expanded values which can be called in the form \fB{{\fR \fIHELPER\fR(\fIVARIABLE\fR) \fB}}\fR. The available helper functions are:
.TP
\fBlc\fR

.TP
\fBuc\fR
